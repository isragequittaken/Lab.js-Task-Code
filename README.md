# Lab.js-Task-Code
The six cognitive tasks I used for this fully virtual study are traditionally physical paper tests (i.e., Sorting Test and Water Jar Problem) or have only been stored as local programs (i.,e Card Sorting, Go/No-Go, Snowy Picture Test, and Alternative Uses Test). <br>
Disclaimer: The Alternative Uses Test code contain 64 images files and was too large to upload to GitHub directly, even when compressed. <br>
<p>I needed to administer these six tasks in a seemless and unified format that would be accessable to anyone with wifi and a keyboard. The participants also needed to be somewhat autonomous and to move through the tasks without requiring continuous intervention from the study administer.
<br> I used Lab.js to program a full interface that would welcome and then guide participants through each task's instructions. </p>
This also included my fully programing these tasks (from nothing) to operate as they traditionally would and to record all reposnes and times throughout each task and across the testing session. To accomplish this I learned the Lab.js system as well as some JavaScript and HTML. 

<br> The code created in Lab.js was importing to Open-Lab, a free resource for online study deployment, which works in tandem with Lab.js for this exact purpose. The raw data generated during the testing sessions was saved in Open-Lab. 

<br> The only task the I did not 100% recreate myself was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The WCST is a classic neuropsychological test that has already been digitized numerous times. I was lucky enough for the bulk of the WCST's complex flow code to have been written for Lab.js by Julian Discher, Robert Mierzwa, and Sergej Schmidt at the University of Konstanz.
